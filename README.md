# Hair-salon

**Hair salon website made with Vue and Bootstrap** 

The project is to create a web page for a local hair salon in MÃ¶lnlycke. The web site will have contact information about the salon and a listing of all services provided.

## ðŸš€ About Me


We are two bachelor students studying software engineering and we are using this project as an opportunity to practice our coding skills in our free time.

In addition to practicing our coding skills, we are also using this project as an opportunity to practice full-stack development. This means that we will be working on both the front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) of the web page.

On the front-end, we will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and style the web page. On the back-end, we will be using a server-side language (Vue) to handle the logic and data storage (MongoDB)for the web page.

By working on both the front-end and back-end of the web page, we will have the opportunity to practice our full-stack development skills and gain a deeper understanding of how web applications are built.

We hope that this project will not only improve our coding skills, but also give us a well-rounded understanding of full-stack development and how all the pieces fit together.
